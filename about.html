      <p>Where engineering meets art — ChippyCraft creates one-of-a-kind, modern-industrial furniture pieces that blend metal and epoxy into designs unlike anything else out there.</p>

    <!-- Personal Story (now highlighted) -->
    <section class="story">
      <h2>Meet the Maker</h2>
      <p>Hey there — I’m <strong>Ryan Bostrom</strong>, owner of <strong>ChippyCraft LLC</strong>.  
      I’m a non-traditional student double-majoring in <em>Engineering Technology</em> and <em>Business Management</em>. Before all this, I spent about a decade in the trades — welding and construction straight out of high school. After years of working for someone else, I realized it was time to take my skills, ideas, and ambition into my own hands and start building the future I actually wanted.</p>

      <p>That drive became <strong>ChippyCraft</strong> — a studio where craftsmanship meets engineering, and where I get to turn raw materials into functional art. Every piece is personal — designed, welded, and finished by hand, a true reflection of the maker behind the hood.</p>

    <!-- ChippyCraft Story -->
    <section class="story">
      <h2>Our Story</h2>
      <p>ChippyCraft started from the belief that cookie-cutter furniture is <strong>boring</strong>. Our vision is to revamp living spaces — inside and out. Every project is an opportunity to reimagine what’s possible when engineering and art collide.</p>

      <p>Our tables and chairs are built to <strong>defy gravity</strong>, merging raw steel and smooth epoxy into bold, modern-industrial designs that command attention. The illusionary framing always leads to a double-take — <em>“Is that table floating?!”</em></p>

      <p>ChippyCraft isn’t mass-produced or factory-fabricated. It’s unapologetically sophisticated, artistic, and sleek. Every piece carries the fingerprints of its maker — a blend of grit, creativity, and technical know-how that turns the mundane into something extraordinary.</p>

    <!-- Art Behind the Craft -->
<section class="craft" style="margin-top:3rem;">
  <h2>The Art Behind the Craft</h2>
  <p style="text-align:center; max-width:700px; margin:0 auto 2rem auto;">
    Every ChippyCraft creation begins with imagination — where design, craftsmanship, and engineering come together to create pieces that blur the line between furniture and art.
  </p>

  <!-- Epoxy Art Subsection -->
  <h3 style="color:#00ffff; text-align:center; text-transform:uppercase; margin-top:1.5rem;">Epoxy Art</h3>
  <p>ChippyCraft was never meant to just build furniture — it was meant to build stories. <strong>You</strong> bring the imagination behind every new design, and the final product becomes a collaboration between maker and owner. Together, <strong>we</strong> create personal pieces that <strong>you</strong> have breathed into life.</p>

  <p>Whether it’s embedding the ashes of a beloved pet, preserving a flower from your wedding day, or immortalizing a symbol that means something only to you — nearly anything can be suspended in clear epoxy, sealed forever in light and time. <strong>Each tabletop is a blank space to capture something timeless.</strong></p>

  <p>My specialty is what I call <strong>metal calligraphy</strong>. It uses thin strips of hand-shaped steel that twist and curve into symbols, lettering, or abstract forms. These lines act like the framework of stained glass, but instead of holding glass, they cradle color — translucent epoxy poured into each shape, one at a time, until the design comes alive.</p>

  <!-- Sheet Metal Art Subsection -->
  <h3 style="color:#00ffff; text-align:center; text-transform:uppercase; margin-top:2.5rem;">Sheet Metal Art</h3>
  <p>Your story doesn’t have to stop indoors — take it outside. Each patio table can be fitted with custom sheet-metal panels that turn structure into statement. From bold patriotic emblems to intricate Celtic knotwork, every CNC-plasma-cut design gives your table its own identity — unmistakable, personal, and built to stand the elements.</p>

  <p>Every panel is powder-coated for durability and can be paired with a backdrop that defines your style: a second sheet of metal for a crisp, modern contrast, or a stained wood backing for a warmer, rustic feel that feels as welcoming as the firelight.</p>

  <p>Every pattern carries its own character. Whether it’s clean geometry, flowing lines, or a symbol that means something only to you, your vision becomes part of the piece — welded, finished, and made to last as long as the memories shared around it.</p>
